Getting started with the project, prepering myself for the hard work and making some progress with respect of the setting up the development environment.

1) main idea: 
   * recreation of the old game called Golden Axe (paying tribute, appriciation for the good times)
   * Having spent a lot of time with this game, I though it would've been a good idea to port to web

2) Initial phase
   * Estalbishing the deleopment environment (grunt tasks, htmlboilerplate)
   * Makin the essential design choices 
      + mostly deciding wich framework should be used: EaselJS, Phraser, melonJS
   * Installing the required components
   * Creating a mockup scene to start playing around
