Day 0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started with the project, prepering myself for the hard work and 
making some progress with respect of the setting up the development 
environment.

1) main idea: 
   * recreation of the old game called Golden Axe (paying tribute, appriciation for the good times)
   * Having spent a lot of time with this game, I though it would've been a good idea to port to web

2) Initial phase
   * Estalbishing the deleopment environment (grunt tasks, htmlboilerplate)
   * Makin the essential design choices 
      + mostly deciding wich framework should be used: EaselJS, Phraser, melonJS
   * Installing the required components
   * Creating a mockup scene to start playing around


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding basic components of EaselJS to the implementation and starting to 
establish the initial structure of the used modules. Building up the game 
loop and implementing the preloading process.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating layout for the scenes, providing them with the appropriate CSS 
classes so that the game can switch between them gracefully using 
fade in/out transitions. 
Linking the scene switching logic to the preloader object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 3
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding event listeners for UI events. As the player will be able control 
the character either by using the keyboard in dekstop mode or touching the
virtual controls on Mobiles, I have to provide a unified solution to 
register business logic to the UI events such as moving towards specified
directions and so forth.
